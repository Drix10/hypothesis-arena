/**
 * The status badge for Claude Code's `statusLine`: whether the guard is wired and what is waiting on a person, in one
 * short line that is there on every screen. A person who comes back to an unattended run sees "2 need you" without
 * typing anything.
 *
 * It runs on every prompt refresh, so it is built to be quick and silent: plain file reads (no git, no scans), and any
 * problem prints nothing rather than an error in the user's status bar.
