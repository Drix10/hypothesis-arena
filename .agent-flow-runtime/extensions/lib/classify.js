/**
 * Mechanical risk classification of a change set.
 *
 * v1.0.2 described this as JavaScript inside a SKILL.md — i.e. the model was
 * asked to "run" it in its head — and the snippet itself had two bugs:
 * `protectedPaths.includes(f)` only matched exact file paths (a protected
 * directory never matched), and `f.includes("auth")` flagged `author.ts`.
 * It also ran BEFORE implementation, when there are no changed files yet.
 *
 * This runs on the real diff, matches directory prefixes and globs from the
 * manifest, and uses path-SEGMENT heuristics only when no boundaries exist.
