/**
 * Verdict binding: a review, a gate run and a QA run only count for the commit they judged.
 *
 * `report --harness` and `gates run --issue` record the tip of agent/issue-N in their audit lines. Before an
 * issue may become `Completed`, the latest review, QA and required-gate results for the current round must all
 * name the tip that is about to be pushed. A commit made after the approval (a resumed run, a manual fix in the
 * worktree, an orchestrator slip) therefore can't ship under an "approved" record it never had.
 *
 * Enforced only for issues whose audit lines carry a `head` (runs made with this version onward): older runs
 * have nothing to compare, and the pipeline that skips `report --harness` is FM-18, not something this can see.
