/**
 * Human confirmation for writes.
 *
 * v1.0.2 gated writes on a string like "CONFIRM_BOOTSTRAP" — which was printed
 * in the tool's own parameter description, so the model could (and would)
 * simply pass it. That is a speed bump, not a gate.
 *
 * Now:
 *  - Interactive (TUI / RPC): Pi shows a real confirm dialog. Only a human can
 *    click it. The token is ignored.
 *  - Headless (`pi -p`): there is no human to ask, so writes are REFUSED unless
 *    the person who launched the process opted in with
 *    AGENT_FLOW_HEADLESS_WRITES=1. The model cannot set that for its own process.
