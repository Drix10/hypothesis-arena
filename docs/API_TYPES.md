# API Types

This section categorizes APIs into two types:

- Public APIs
- Private APIs

## Public APIs

Public APIs allow users to retrieve configuration and market data. These requests do not require authentication.

## Private APIs

Private APIs enable order management and account management. Each private request must be authenticated using a standardized signature method. Private APIs require validation with your API key.
